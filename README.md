Story:
A 2D platformer game where you play as Theseus and have been transported into a digital Greek labyrinth hounded by classic monsters from Greek mythology (including the infamous Minotaur). You must escape the various levels of the maze before the Minotaur catches you! Basic keyboard input controls include moving left/right and jumping. A twist to the game is that you can rotate the screen to get to areas you may otherwise not be able to reach.
