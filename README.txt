Creative Part
Added the suggested feature (a) where the salmon bounces off the boundaries of the screen.
The relevant code can be found in the salmon.cpp, salmon.hpp, and world.cpp files.
Most of the logic sits in the Salmon::update function, with some initialization code
in Salmon::init and the advanced_mode toggle logic in World::on_key function.
